# ls Command:

The ls command lists the files and directories in a specified directory.
By default, if you simply type ls, it shows the contents of the current directory.
You can use options with ls to display more detailed information. For example:

- ls -l: Lists files in a long format, showing file permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
- ls -a: Shows all files, including hidden files (those that start with a dot .).
- ls -lh: Lists files in a human-readable format, displaying file sizes in KB, MB, etc.

# cat Command:

- The cat command is short for "concatenate" and is used to display the contents of a file on the screen.
- It's often used to quickly view the contents of text files.
- You can also use cat to combine (concatenate) multiple files and display or save the output to another file.

Example usage:
- cat filename.txt: Displays the contents of filename.txt.
- cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt: Combines the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt into a new file called combined.txt
